# Arc

## What is the Arc?

Cratis Arc is a comprehensive development framework that provides a structured, opinionated approach to building modern applications. It delivers a cohesive set of libraries, patterns, and tools that work together to accelerate development while maintaining consistency, quality, and maintainability across your codebase.

Rather than assembling disparate libraries and creating your own patterns, the Arc provides a unified foundation that covers everything from backend APIs to frontend user interfaces, with built-in support for modern architectural patterns like CQRS, event sourcing, and domain-driven design.
