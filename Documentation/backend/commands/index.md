# Commands

The Application Model provides comprehensive support for implementing commands in your backend application. Commands represent actions or operations that modify the state of your system and are a fundamental part of CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) architecture.

## Overview

Commands in the Application Model are designed to be simple to implement while providing powerful features like automatic validation, response handling, and integration with the overall application architecture. Whether you prefer controller-based approaches or model-bound commands, the framework provides the flexibility to work with your preferred style while maintaining consistency and best practices.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Response Handling**: Command handlers can return any value, which will either be processed by custom response value handlers or automatically become a typed `CommandResult<T>` response
- **Flexible Return Types**: Support for single values, tuples, and OneOf types with intelligent processing
- **Built-in Validation**: Automatic command validation before execution
- **Response Value Handlers**: Extensible system for processing specific types of return values
- **Controller and Model-Bound Support**: Multiple patterns for implementing commands
- **TypeScript Integration**: Automatic proxy generation for frontend integration
