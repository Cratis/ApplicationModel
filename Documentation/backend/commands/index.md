## Overview

Commands in the Application Model are designed to be simple to implement while providing powerful features like automatic validation, response handling, and integration with the overall application architecture. Whether you prefer controller-based approaches or model-bound commands, the framework provides the flexibility to work with your preferred style while maintaining consistency and best practices.
