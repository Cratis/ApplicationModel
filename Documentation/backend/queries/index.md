# Queries

The Application Model provides comprehensive support for implementing queries in your backend application.
Queries are used for retrieving data and are a key component of CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) architecture, offering powerful features like observability, validation, and flexible parameter handling.

## Overview

Queries in the Application Model are designed to be flexible and powerful, supporting both traditional request-response patterns and reactive, observable queries that can provide real-time updates.
The framework handles parameter validation, binding, and processing through a comprehensive pipeline that ensures consistent behavior across your application.
Query arguments and parameter binding are covered within the controller-based and model-bound topics.
